# Algorithm Analysis

## Insertion Sort

-   Takes n^2 time complexity to sort the Array
-   Better for small sized arrays

## Merge Sort

-   Takes n(ln(n)) time complexity to sort the Array
-   Better for large sized arrays

## Hybrid Merge Sort

-   Hybrid version of Merge and Insertion sort algorithm to provide better results and time complexity
-   Sorts large sized arrays by **Merge Sort** until **Insertion Sort** Algorithm becomes more efficient and sorts the remaining small sized arrays by insertion sort algorithm
